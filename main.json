        "fixed-block architecture fixed-block architecture fba is an ibm term for the hdd layout in which each addressable more commonly, on the disk has the same size, utilizing 4 byte block numbers and a new set of command codes.",

        "overview from until the early 1960s most hard disk drive data were addressed in the form of a three number block addressing scheme the cylinder number, which positioned the head access mechanism the head number, which selected the read-write head and the sector number, which specified the rotational position of a fixed size block.",
        "on june 2, 1961, ibm introduced the , which had variable length records, and the market for sector-oriented disks was eclipsed for decades.",
        "ibm s 1964 introduced their new self-formatting for disk and other random-access drives, wherein each record had an optional variable length key field and a variable length data field.",
        "ibm mainframe disk, drum and mass storage devices, called dasd are addressed using a six byte seek address for seek commands and a five byte cchhr for search count commands.",
        "and other s/360 operating systems used an 8-byte address structured as mbbcchhr extent m a -bin bb b -cylinder cc -head hh -record r , 2 which was capable of storing records of varying size, up to 255 such records per track, with the zeroth record r0 being reserved for certain error correction information, such as skip defects .",
        "in addition to data, records could also contain a key.",
        "the length of the key, like the length of the data, was specified by the application writing the record.",
        "in addition to addressing records by number, it was possible to search disks by key, using the underlying ckd structure.",
        "the term fixed-block architecture was created by ibm in 1979 3 to distinguish this format from its variable-length record format.",
        "fixed-block architecture was adopted for a few mainframe hdds produced by ibm beginning in the 1970s, and contemporary dasd systems continue to support 3310 and 3370 compatibility.",
        "continues to require ckd dasd, although by the 1990s all new ibm hdds used fixed sectors internally.",

        "blocks are typically separated on the by inter-record gaps.",
        "together, the block size and the size of the inter-record gap determine how many blocks can fit in each track.",
        "to read or write a block on an fba disk, the computer would address the block using the traditional chs three number address.",
        "later formats block number was translated into a cylinder number, head number and sector number.",
        "moving the translation into the disk drive allowed drive manufacturers to place a different number of blocks on each track transparently to the accessing software.",
