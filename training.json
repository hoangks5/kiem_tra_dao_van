        "3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model.",
        "1 The term 3D printing can refer to a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, 2 with material being added together such as plastics, liquids or powder grains being fused together , typically layer by layer.",
        "In the 1980s, 3D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes, and a more appropriate term for it at the time was rapid prototyping.",
        "3 As of 2019, the precision, repeatability, and material range of 3D printing have increased to the point that some 3D printing processes are considered viable as an industrial-production technology, whereby the term additive manufacturing can be used synonymously with 3D printing.",
        "4 One of the key advantages of 3D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries that would be otherwise impossible to construct by hand, including hollow parts or parts with internal truss structures to reduce weight.",
        "Fused deposition modeling FDM , which uses a continuous filament of a thermoplastic material, is the most common 3D printing process in use as of 2020.",
        "Terminology The umbrella term additive manufacturing AM gained popularity in the 2000s, 6 inspired by the theme of material being added together in any of various ways .",
        "In contrast, the term subtractive manufacturing appeared as a retronym for the large family of machining processes with material removal as their common process.",
        "The term 3D printing still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds, and the term AM was more likely to be used in metalworking and end-use part production contexts than among polymer, inkjet, or stereolithography enthusiasts.",
        "Inkjet was the least familiar technology even though it was invented in 1950 and poorly understood because of its complex nature.",
        "The earliest inkjets were used as recorders and not printers.",
        "As late as the 1970s the term recorder was associated with inkjet.",
        "Continuous Inkjet later evolved to On-Demand or Drop-On-Demand Inkjet.",
        "Inkjets were single nozzle at the start they may now have as many as thousands of nozzles for printing in each pass over a surface.",
        "By the early 2010s, the terms 3D printing and additive manufacturing evolved senses in which they were alternate umbrella terms for additive technologies, one being used in popular language by consumer-maker communities and the media, and the other used more formally by industrial end-use part producers, machine manufacturers, and global technical standards organizations.",
        "Until recently, the term 3D printing has been associated with machines low in price or in capability.",
        "7 3D printing and additive manufacturing reflect that the technologies share the theme of material addition or joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control.",
        "Peter Zelinski, the editor-in-chief of Additive Manufacturing magazine, pointed out in 2017 that the terms are still often synonymous in casual usage, 8 but some manufacturing industry experts are trying to make a distinction whereby additive manufacturing comprises 3D printing plus other technologies or other aspects of a manufacturing process.",
        "8 Processes and printers Applications Food industry Fashion industry Transportation industry Firearm industry Health sector Education sector Cultural heritage and museum-based digital twin Recent other applications Legal aspects Intellectual property Gun legislation and administration Aerospace regulation Health and safety Impact Social change Environmental change See also References Further reading External links Other terms that have been used as synonyms or hypernyms have included desktop manufacturing, rapid manufacturing as the logical production-level successor to rapid prototyping , and on-demand manufacturing which echoes on-demand printing in the 2D sense of printing .",
        "Such application of the adjectives rapid and on-demand to the noun manufacturing was novel in the 2000s reveals the prevailing mental model of the long industrial era in which almost all production manufacturing involved long lead times for laborious tooling development.",
        "Today, the term subtractive has not replaced the term machining, instead complementing it when a term that covers any removal method is needed.",
        "Agile tooling is the use of modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods to enable quick prototyping and responses to tooling and fixture needs.",
        "Agile tooling uses a cost-effective and high-quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs, and it can be used in hydro-forming, stamping, injection molding and other manufacturing processes.",
        "History 1940s and 1950s The general concept of and procedure to be used in 3D-printing was first described by Murray Leinster in his 1945 short story Things Pass By \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut this constructor is both efficient and flexible.",
        "I feed magnetronic plastics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the stuff they make houses and ships of nowadays \u00e2\u0080\u0094 into this moving arm.",
        "It makes drawings in the air following drawings it scans with photo-cells.",
        "But plastic comes out of the end of the drawing arm and hardens as it comes ... following drawings only\u00e2\u0080\u009d 9 It was also described by Raymond F. Jones in his story, Tools of the Trade, published in the November 1950 issue of Astounding Science Fiction magazine.",
        "He referred to it as a molecular spray in that story.",
        "1970s In 1971, Johannes F Gottwald patented the Liquid Metal Recorder, US3596285A, a continuous Inkjet metal material device to form a removable metal fabrication on a reusable surface for immediate use or salvaged for printing again by remelting.",
        "This appears to be the first patent describing 3D printing with rapid prototyping and controlled on-demand manufacturing of patterns.",
        "The patent states As used herein the term printing is not intended in a limited sense but includes writing or other symbols, character or pattern formation with an ink.",
        "The term ink as used in is intended to include not only dye or pigment-containing materials, but any flowable substance or composition suited for application to the surface for forming symbols, characters, or patterns of intelligence by marking.",
        "The preferred ink is of a Hot melt type.",
        "The range of commercially available ink compositions which could meet the requirements of the invention are not known at the present time.",
        "However, satisfactory printing according to the invention has been achieved with the conductive metal alloy as ink.",
        "But in terms of material requirements for such large and continuous displays, if consumed at theretofore known rates, but increased in proportion to increase in size, the high cost would severely limit any widespread enjoyment of a process or apparatus satisfying the foregoing objects.",
        "It is therefore an additional object of the invention to minimize use to materials in a process of the indicated class.",
        "It is a further object of the invention that materials employed in such a process be salvaged for reuse.",
        "According to another aspect of the invention, a combination for writing and the like comprises a carrier for displaying an intelligence pattern and an arrangement for removing the pattern from the carrier.",
        "In 1974, David E. H. Jones laid out the concept of 3D printing in his regular column Ariadne in the journal New Scientist.",
        "10 11 1980s Early additive manufacturing equipment and materials were developed in the 1980s.",
        "12 In April 1980, Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute invented two additive methods for fabricating three-dimensional plastic models with photo-hardening thermoset polymer, where the UV exposure area is controlled by a mask pattern or a scanning fiber transmitter.",

        "On 2 July 1984, American entrepreneur Bill Masters filed a patent for his Computer Automated Manufacturing Process and System US 4665492 https //patents.google.com/patent/US4665492 .",
        "17 This filing is on record at the USPTO as the first 3D printing patent in history it was the first of three patents belonging to Masters that laid the foundation for the 3D printing systems used today.",

        "20 The application of the French inventors was abandoned by the French General Electric Company now Alcatel-Alsthom and CILAS The Laser Consortium .",
        "21 The claimed reason was for lack of business perspective .",
        "22 In 1983, Robert Howard started R.H. Research, later named Howtek, Inc. in Feb 1984 to develop a color inkjet 2D printer, Pixelmaster, commercialized in 1986, using Thermoplastic hot-melt plastic ink.",
        "23 A team was put together, 6 members 23 from Exxon Office Systems, Danbury Systems Division, an inkjet printer startup and some members of Howtek, Inc group who became popular figures in 3D Printing Industry.",
        "One Howtek member, Richard Helinski patent US5136515A, Method and Means for constructing three-dimensional articles by particle deposition, application 11/07/1989 granted 8/04/1992 formed a New Hampshire company C.A.D-Cast, Inc, name later changed to Visual Impact Corporation VIC on 8/22/1991.",

        "This Howtek hot-melt thermoplastic technology is popular with metal investment casting, especially in the 3D printing jewelry industry.",
        "24 Sanders SDI first Modelmaker 6Pro customer was Hitchner Corporations, Metal Casting Technology, Inc in Milford, NH a mile from the SDI facility in late 1993-1995 casting golf clubs and auto engine parts.",
        "On 8 August 1984 a patent, US4575330, assigned to UVP, Inc., later assigned to Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corporation 25 was filed, his own patent for a stereolithography fabrication system, in which individual laminae or layers are added by curing photopolymers with impinging radiation, particle bombardment, chemical reaction or just ultraviolet light lasers.",
        "Hull defined the process as a system for generating three-dimensional objects by creating a cross-sectional pattern of the object to be formed, .",
        "26 27 Hull s contribution was the STL Stereolithography file format and the digital slicing and infill strategies common to many processes today.",
        "In 1986, Charles Chuck Hull was granted a patent for this system, and his company, 3D Systems Corporation was formed and it released the first commercial 3D printer, the SLA-1, 28 later in 1987 or 1988.",
        "The technology used by most 3D printers to date\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially hobbyist and consumer-oriented models\u00e2\u0080\u0094is fused deposition modeling, a special application of plastic extrusion, developed in 1988 by S. Scott Crump and commercialized by his company Stratasys, which marketed its first FDM machine in 1992.",
        "24 Owning a 3D printer in the 1980s cost upwards of 300,000 650,000 in 2016 dollars .",
        "29 1990s AM processes for metal sintering or melting such as selective laser sintering, direct metal laser sintering, and selective laser melting usually went by their own individual names in the 1980s and 1990s.",
        "At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that are now called non-additive casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies such as by robot welding and CNC , the idea of a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape with a toolpath was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal rather than adding it , such as CNC milling, CNC EDM, and many others.",
        "But the automated techniques that added metal, which would later be called additive manufacturing, were beginning to challenge that assumption.",
        "By the mid-1990s, new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, including microcasting 30 and sprayed materials.",
        "31 Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common, enabling new object geometries.",
        "32 The term 3D printing originally referred to a powder bed process employing standard and custom inkjet print heads, developed at MIT by Emanuel Sachs in 1993 and commercialized by Soligen Technologies, Extrude Hone Corporation, and Z Corporation.",
        "The year 1993 also saw the start of an inkjet 3D printer company initially named Sanders Prototype,Inc and later named Solidscape, introducing a high-precision polymer jet fabrication system with soluble support structures, categorized as a dot-on-dot technique .",
        "24 In 1995 the Fraunhofer Society developed the selective laser melting process.",
        "2000s Fused Deposition Modeling FDM printing process patents expired in 2009.",
        "33 2010s As the various additive processes matured, it became clear that soon metal removal would no longer be the only metalworking process done through a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope, transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer.",
        "The 2010s were the first decade in which metal end use parts such as engine brackets 34 and large nuts 35 would be grown either before or instead of machining in job production rather than obligately being machined from bar stock or plate.",
        "It is still the case that casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining are more prevalent than additive manufacturing in metalworking, but AM is now beginning to make significant inroads, and with the advantages of design for additive manufacturing, it is clear to engineers that much more is to come.",
        "One place that AM is making a significant inroad is in the aviation industry.",
        "With nearly 3.8 billion air travelers in 2016, 36 the demand for fuel efficient and easily produced jet engines has never been higher.",
        "For large OEMs original equipment manufacturers like Pratt and Whitney PW and General Electric GE this means looking towards AM as a way to reduce cost, reduce the number of nonconforming parts, reduce weight in the engines to increase fuel efficiency and find new, highly complex shapes that would not be feasible with the antiquated manufacturing methods.",
        "One example of AM integration with aerospace was in 2016 when Airbus was delivered the first of GE s LEAP engine.",
        "This engine has integrated 3D printed fuel nozzles giving them a reduction in parts from 20 to 1, a 25 weight reduction and reduced assembly times.",
        "37 A fuel nozzle is the perfect in road for additive manufacturing in a jet engine since it allows for optimized design of the complex internals and it is a low stress, non-rotating part.",
        "Similarly, in 2015, PW delivered their first AM parts in the PurePower PW1500G to Bombardier.",
        "Sticking to low stress, non-rotating parts, PW selected the compressor stators and synch ring brackets 38 to roll out this new manufacturing technology for the first time.",
        "While AM is still playing a small role in the total number of parts in the jet engine manufacturing process, the return on investment can already be seen by the reduction in parts, the rapid production capabilities and the optimized design in terms of performance and cost .",
        "39 As technology matured, several authors had begun to speculate that 3D printing could aid in sustainable development in the developing world.",
        "40 In 2012, Filabot developed a system for closing the loop 41 with plastic and allows for any FDM or FFF 3D printer to be able to print with a wider range of plastics.",
        "In 2014, Benjamin S. Cook and Manos M. Tentzeris demonstrate the first multi-material, vertically integrated printed electronics additive manufacturing platform VIPRE which enabled 3D printing of functional electronics operating up to 40 GHz.",
        "42 As the price of printers started to drop people interested in this technology had more access and freedom to make what they wanted.",
        "The price as of 2014 was still high with the cost being over 2,000, yet this still allowed hobbyists an entrance into printing outside of production and industry methods.",
        "43 The term 3D printing originally referred to a process that deposits a binder material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads layer by layer.",
        "More recently, the popular vernacular has started using the term to encompass a wider variety of additive-manufacturing techniques such as electron-beam additive manufacturing and selective laser melting.",
        "The United States and global technical standards use the official term additive manufacturing for this broader sense.",
        "The most-commonly used 3D printing process 46 as of 2018 is a material extrusion technique called fused deposition modeling, or FDM.",
        "5 While FDM technology was invented after the other two most popular technologies, stereolithography SLA and selective laser sintering SLS , FDM is typically the most inexpensive of the three by a large margin, which lends to the popularity of the process.",
        "2020s As of 2020, 3D printers have reached the level of quality and price that allows most people to enter the world of 3D printing.",
        "In 2020 decent quality printers can be found for less than US 200 for entry level machines.",
        "These more affordable printers are usually fused deposition modeling FDM printers.",
        "44 General principles Modeling 3D printable models may be created with a computer-aided design CAD package, via a 3D scanner, or by a plain digital camera and photogrammetry software.",
        "3D printed models created with CAD result in relatively fewer errors than other methods.",
        "Errors in 3D printable models can be identified and corrected before printing.",
        "45 The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting.",
        "3D scanning is a process of collecting digital data on the shape and appearance of a real object, creating a digital model based on it.",
        "CAD models can be saved in the stereolithography file format STL , a de facto CAD file format for additive manufacturing that stores data based on triangulations of the surface of CAD models.",
        "STL is not tailored for additive manufacturing because it generates large file sizes of topology optimized parts and lattice structures due to the large number of surfaces involved.",
        "A newer CAD file format, the Additive Manufacturing File format AMF was introduced in 2011 to solve this problem.",
        "It stores information using curved triangulations.",
        "46 Printing Before printing a 3D model from an STL file, it must first be examined for errors.",
        "Most CAD applications produce errors in output STL files, 47 48 of the following types 1. holes 2. faces normals 3. self-intersections 4. noise shells 5. manifold errors.",
        "49 A step in the STL generation known as repair fixes such problems in the original model.",
        "50 51 Generally STLs that have been produced from a model obtained through 3D scanning often have more of these errors 52 as 3D scanning is often achieved by point to point acquisition/mapping.",
        "3D reconstruction often includes errors.",
        "53 Once completed, the STL file needs to be processed by a piece of software called a slicer, which converts the model into a series of thin layers and produces a G-code file containing instructions tailored to a specific type of 3D printer FDM printers .",
        "54 This G-code file can then be printed with 3D printing client software which loads the G-code, and uses it to instruct the 3D printer during the 3D printing process .",
        "CAD model used for 3D printing 3D models can be generated from 2D pictures taken at a 3D photo booth.",
        "Printer resolution describes layer thickness and X\u00e2\u0080\u0093Y resolution in dots per inch dpi or micrometers \u00ce\u00bcm .",
        "Typical layer thickness is around 100 \u00ce\u00bcm 250 DPI , although some machines can print layers as thin as 16 \u00ce\u00bcm 1,600 DPI .",
        "55 X\u00e2\u0080\u0093Y resolution is comparable to that of laser printers.",
        "The particles 3D dots are around 50 to 100 \u00ce\u00bcm 510 to 250 DPI in diameter.",
        "For that printer resolution, specifying a mesh resolution of 0.01\u00e2\u0080\u00930.03 mm and a chord length \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 0.016 mm generates an optimal STL output file for a given model input file.",
        "56 Specifying higher resolution results in larger files without increase in print quality.",
        "Construction of a model with contemporary methods can take anywhere from several hours to several days, depending on the method used and the size and complexity of the model.",
        "Additive systems can typically reduce this time to a few hours, although it varies widely depending on the type of machine used and the size and number of models being produced simultaneously.",
        "Finishing Though the printer-produced resolution is sufficient for many applications, greater accuracy can be achieved by printing a slightly oversized version of the desired object in standard resolution and then removing material using a higher-resolution subtractive process.",
        "57 The layered structure of all additive manufacturing processes leads inevitably to a stair-stepping effect on part surfaces which are curved or tilted in respect to the building platform.",
        "The effects strongly depend on the orientation of a part surface inside the building process.",
        "58 Some printable polymers such as ABS, allow the surface finish to be smoothed and improved using chemical vapor processes 59 based on acetone or similar solvents.",
        "Some additive manufacturing techniques are capable of using multiple materials in the course of constructing parts.",
        "These techniques are able to print in multiple colors and color combinations simultaneously, and would not necessarily require painting.",
        "Some printing techniques require internal supports to be built for overhanging features during construction.",
        "These supports must be mechanically removed or dissolved upon completion of the print.",
        "All of the commercialized metal 3D printers involve cutting the metal component off the metal substrate after deposition.",
        "A new process for the GMAW 3D printing allows for substrate surface modifications to remove aluminum 60 or steel.",
        "61 Materials Traditionally, 3D printing focused on polymers for printing, due to the ease of manufacturing and handling polymeric materials.",
        "However, the method has rapidly evolved to not only print various polymers 62 but also metals 63 64 and ceramics, 65 making 3D printing a versatile option for manufacturing.",
        "Layer-by- layer fabrication of three-dimensional physical models is a modern concept that stems from the ever- growing CAD industry, more specifically the solid modeling side of CAD.",
        "Before solid modeling was introduced in the late 1980s, three-dimensional models were created with wire frames and surfaces.",
        "66 but in all cases the layers of materials are controlled by the printer and the material properties.",
        "The three- dimensional material layer is controlled by deposition rate as set by the printer operator and stored in a computer file.",
        "The earliest printed patented material was a Hot melt type ink for printing patterns using a heated metal alloy.",
        "See 1970 s history above.",
        "Charles Hull filed the first patent on August 8, 1984, to use a UV- cured acrylic resin using a UV masked light source at UVP Corp to build a simple model.",

        "Accelerated Graphics Port AGP is a parallel expansion card standard, designed for attaching a video card to a computer system to assist in the acceleration of 3D computer graphics.",
        "It was originally designed as a successor to PCI-type connections for video cards.",
        "Since 2004, AGP has been progressively phased out in favor of PCI Express PCIe , which is serial, as opposed to parallel by mid-2008, PCI Express cards dominated the market and only a few AGP models were available, 1 with GPU manufacturers and add-in board partners eventually dropping support for the interface in favor of PCI Express.",
        "As computers increasingly became graphically oriented, successive generations of graphics adapters began to push the limits of PCI, a bus with shared bandwidth.",
        "This led to the development of AGP, a bus dedicated to graphics adapters.",
        "AGP is heavily based on PCI, and in fact the AGP bus is a superset of the conventional PCI bus, and AGP cards must act as PCI cards.",
        "The primary advantage of AGP over PCI is that it provides a dedicated pathway between the slot s and the processor rather than sharing the PCI bus.",
        "In addition to a lack of contention for the bus, the direct connection allows for higher clock speeds.",
        "The second major change is that AGP uses split transactions, where the address and data phases of a PCI transaction are separated.",
        "The card may send many address phases, and the host processes them in order.",
        "This avoids long delays, with the bus idle, during read operations.",
        "Third, PCI bus handshaking is simplified.",
        "Unlike PCI bus transactions whose length is negotiated on a cycle-by-cycle basis using the FRAME and STOP signals, AGP transfers are always a multiple of 8 bytes long, and the total length is included in the request.",
        "Further, rather than using the IRDY and TRDY signals for each word, data is transferred in blocks of four clock cycles 32 words at AGP 8\u00c3\u0097 speed , and pauses are allowed only between blocks.",
        "Finally, AGP allows optional in AGP 1.0 and 2.0, mandatory in AGP 3.0 sideband addressing, meaning that the address and data buses are separated so the address phase does not use the main address/data AD lines at all.",
        "This is done by adding an extra 8-bit SideBand Address bus over which the graphics controller can issue new AGP requests while other AGP data is flowing over the main 32 address/data AD lines.",
        "This results in improved overall AGP data throughput.",
        "This great improvement in memory read performance makes it practical for an AGP card to read textures directly from system RAM, while a PCI graphics card must copy it from system RAM to the card s video memory.",

        "Some early AGP boards used graphics processors built around PCI and were simply bridged to AGP.",
        "This resulted in the cards benefiting little from the new bus, with the only improvement used being the 66 MHz bus clock, with its resulting doubled bandwidth over PCI, and bus exclusivity.",
        "Examples of such cards were the Voodoo Banshee, Ve\u00cc\u0081rite\u00cc\u0081 V2200, Millennium II, and S3 ViRGE GX/2.",
        "Intel s i740 was explicitly designed to exploit the new AGP feature set in fact it was designed to texture only from AGP memory, making PCI versions of the board difficult to implement local board RAM had to emulate AGP memory.",

        "Asymmetric digital subscriber line Asymmetric digital subscriber line ADSL is a type of digital subscriber line DSL technology, a data communications technology that enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a conventional voiceband modem can provide.",
        "ADSL differs from the less common symmetric digital subscriber line SDSL .",
        "In ADSL, bandwidth and bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer premises downstream than the reverse upstream .",
        "Providers usually market ADSL as an Internet access service primarily for downloading content from the Internet, but not for serving content accessed by others.",
        "Contents Overview ADSL works by using spectrum above the band used by voice telephone calls.",
        "1 With a DSL filter, often called splitter, the frequency bands are isolated, permitting a single telephone line to be used for both ADSL service and telephone calls at the same time.",
        "ADSL is generally only installed for short distances from the telephone exchange the last mile , typically less than 4 kilometres 2 mi , 2 but has been known to exceed 8 kilometres 5 mi if the originally laid wire gauge allows for further distribution.",
        "At the telephone exchange, the line generally terminates at a digital subscriber line access multiplexer DSLAM where another frequency splitter separates the voice band signal for the conventional phone network.",
        "Data carried by the ADSL are typically routed over the telephone company s data network and eventually reach a conventional Internet Protocol network.",
        "There are both technical and marketing reasons why ADSL is in many places the most common type offered to home users.",
        "On the technical side, there is likely to be more crosstalk from other circuits at the DSLAM end where the wires from many local loops are close to each other than at the customer premises.",
        "Thus the upload signal is weakest at the noisiest part of the local loop, while the download signal is strongest at the noisiest part of the local loop.",
        "It therefore makes technical sense to have the DSLAM transmit at a higher bit rate than does the modem on the customer end.",
        "Since the typical home user in fact does prefer a higher download speed, the telephone companies chose to make a virtue out of necessity, hence ADSL.",
        "The marketing reasons for an asymmetric connection are that, firstly, most users of internet traffic will require less data to be uploaded than downloaded.",
        "For example, in normal web browsing, a user will visit a number of web sites and will need to download the data that comprises the web pages from the site, images, text, sound files etc.",
        "but they will only upload a small amount of data, as the only uploaded data is that used for the purpose of verifying the receipt of the downloaded data in very common TCP connections or any data inputted by the user into forms etc.",
        "This provides a justification for internet service providers to offer a more expensive service aimed at commercial users who host websites, and who therefore need a service which allows for as much data to be uploaded as downloaded.",
        "File sharing applications are an obvious exception to this situation.",
        "Secondly internet service providers, seeking to avoid overloading of their backbone connections, have traditionally tried to limit uses such as file sharing which generate a lot of uploads.",
        "Operation Currently, most ADSL communication is full-duplex.",
        "Full-duplex ADSL communication is usually achieved on a wire pair by either frequency-division duplex FDD , echo-cancelling duplex ECD , or time-division duplex TDD .",
        "FDD uses two separate frequency bands, referred to as the upstream and downstream bands.",
        "The upstream band is used for communication from the end user to the telephone central office.",
        "The downstream band is used for communicating from the central office to the end user.",
        "With commonly deployed ADSL over POTS Annex A , the band from 26.075 kHz to 137.825 kHz is used for upstream communication, while 138\u00e2\u0080\u00931104 kHz is used for downstream communication.",
        "Under the usual DMT scheme, each of these is further divided into smaller frequency channels of 4.3125 kHz.",
        "These frequency channels are sometimes termed bins.",
        "During initial training to optimize transmission quality and speed, the ADSL modem tests each of the bins to determine the signal-to- noise ratio at each bin s frequency.",
        "Distance from the telephone exchange, cable characteristics, interference from AM radio stations, and local interference and electrical noise at the modem s location can adversely affect the signal-to-noise ratio at particular frequencies.",
        "Bins for frequencies exhibiting a reduced signal-to- noise ratio will be used at a lower throughput rate or not at all this reduces the maximum link capacity but allows the modem to maintain an adequate connection.",
        "The DSL modem will make a plan on how to exploit each of the bins, sometimes termed bits per bin allocation.",
        "Those bins that have a good signal-to-noise ratio SNR will be chosen to transmit signals chosen from a greater number of possible encoded values this range of possibilities equating to more bits of data sent in each main clock cycle.",
        "The number of possibilities must not be so large that the receiver might incorrectly decode which one was intended in the presence of noise.",
        "Noisy bins may only be required to carry as few as two bits, a choice from only one of four possible patterns, or only one bit per bin in the case of ADSL2+, and very noisy bins are not used at all.",
        "If the Frequency plan for ADSL Annex A.",
        "Red area is the frequency range used by normal voice telephony PSTN , the green upstream and blue downstream areas are used for ADSL.",
        "pattern of noise versus frequencies heard in the bins changes, the DSL modem can alter the bits-per-bin allocations, in a process called bitswap , where bins that have become more noisy are only required to carry fewer bits and other channels will be chosen to be given a higher burden.",
        "The data transfer capacity the DSL modem therefore reports is determined by the total of the bits-per-bin allocations of all the bins combined.",
        "Higher signal-to-noise ratios and more bins being in use gives a higher total link capacity, while lower signal-to-noise ratios or fewer bins being used gives a low link capacity.",
        "The total maximum capacity derived from summing the bits-per-bin is reported by DSL modems and is sometimes termed sync rate.",
        "This will always be rather misleading the true maximum link capacity for user data transfer rate will be significantly lower because extra data are transmitted that are termed protocol overhead, reduced figures for PPPoA connections of around 84\u00e2\u0080\u009387 percent, at most, being common.",
        "In addition, some ISPs will have traffic policies that limit maximum transfer rates further in the networks beyond the exchange, and traffic congestion on the Internet, heavy loading on servers and slowness or inefficiency in customers computers may all contribute to reductions below the maximum attainable.",
        "When a wireless access point is used, low or unstable wireless signal quality can also cause reduction or fluctuation of actual speed.",
        "In fixed-rate mode, the sync rate is predefined by the operator and the DSL modem chooses a bits-per-bin allocation that yields an approximately equal error rate in each bin.",
        "3 In variable-rate mode, the bits-per-bin are chosen to maximize the sync rate, subject to a tolerable error risk.",
        "3 These choices can either be conservative, where the modem chooses to allocate fewer bits per bin than it possibly could, a choice which makes for a slower connection, or less conservative in which more bits per bin are chosen in which case there is a greater risk case of error should future signal-to-noise ratios deteriorate to the point where the bits- per-bin allocations chosen are too high to cope with the greater noise present.",
        "This conservatism, involving a choice of using fewer bits per bin as a safeguard against future noise increases, is reported as the signal- to-noise ratio margin or SNR margin.",
        "The telephone exchange can indicate a suggested SNR margin to the customer s DSL modem when it initially connects, and the modem may make its bits-per-bin allocation plan accordingly.",
        "A high SNR margin will mean a reduced maximum throughput, but greater reliability and stability of the connection.",
        "A low SNR margin will mean high speeds, provided the noise level does not increase too much otherwise, the connection will have to be dropped and renegotiated resynced .",
        "ADSL2+ can better accommodate such circumstances, offering a feature termed seamless rate adaptation SRA , which can accommodate changes in total link capacity with less disruption to communications.",
        "Vendors may support usage of higher frequencies as a proprietary extension to the standard.",
        "However, this requires matching vendor- supplied equipment on both ends of the line, and will likely result in crosstalk problems that affect other lines in the same bundle.",
        "There is a direct relationship between the number of channels available and the throughput capacity of the ADSL connection.",
        "The exact data capacity per channel depends on the modulation method used.",
        "ADSL initially existed in two versions similar to VDSL , namely CAP and DMT.",
        "CAP was the de facto standard for ADSL deployments up until 1996, deployed in 90 percent of ADSL installations at the time.",
        "However, DMT was chosen for the first ITU-T ADSL standards, G.992.1 and G.992.2 also called G.dmt and G.lite respectively .",
        "Therefore, all modern installations of ADSL are based on the DMT modulation scheme.",
        "Frequency spectrum of modem on ADSL line Interleaving and fastpath ISPs but users rarely, apart from Australia where it s the default 4 have the option to use interleaving of packets to counter the effects of burst noise on the telephone line.",
        "An interleaved line has a depth, usually 8 to 64, which describes how many Reed\u00e2\u0080\u0093Solomon codewords are accumulated before they are sent.",
        "As they can all be sent together, their forward error correction codes can be made more resilient.",
        "Interleaving adds latency as all the packets have to first be gathered or replaced by empty packets and they, of course, all take time to transmit.",
        "8 frame interleaving adds 5 ms round-trip-time, while 64 deep interleaving adds 25 ms. Other possible depths are 16 and 32.",
        "Fastpath connections have an interleaving depth of 1, that is one packet is sent at a time.",
        "This has a low latency, usually around 10 ms interleaving adds to it, this is not greater than interleaved but it is extremely prone to errors, as any burst of noise can take out the entire packet and so require it all to be retransmitted.",
        "Such a burst on a large interleaved packet only blanks part of the packet, it can be recovered from error correction information in the rest of the packet.",
        "A fastpath connection will result in extremely high latency on a poor line, as each packet will take many retries.",
        "Installation problems ADSL deployment on an existing plain old telephone service POTS telephone line presents some problems because the DSL is within a frequency band that might interact unfavorably with existing equipment connected to the line.",
        "It is therefore necessary to install appropriate frequency filters at the customer s premises to avoid interference between the DSL, voice services, and any other connections to the line for example intruder alarms .",
        "This is desirable for the voice service and essential for a reliable ADSL connection.",
        "In the early days of DSL, installation required a technician to visit the premises.",
        "A splitter or microfilter was installed near the demarcation point, from which a dedicated data line was installed.",
        "This way, the DSL signal is separated as close as possible to the central office and is not attenuated inside the customer s premises.",
        "However, this procedure was costly, and also caused problems with customers complaining about having to wait for the technician to perform the installation.",
        "So, many DSL providers started offering a self-install option, in which the provider provided equipment and instructions to the customer.",
        "Instead of separating the DSL signal at the demarcation point, the DSL signal is filtered at each telephone outlet by use of a low-pass filter for voice and a high-pass filter for data, usually enclosed in what is known as a microfilter.",
        "This microfilter can be plugged by an end user into any telephone jack it does not require any rewiring at the customer s premises.",
        "Commonly, microfilters are only low-pass filters, so beyond them only low frequencies voice signals can pass.",
        "In the data section, a microfilter is not used because digital devices that are intended to extract data from the DSL signal will, themselves, filter out low frequencies.",
        "Voice telephone devices will pick up the entire spectrum so high frequencies, including the ADSL signal, will be heard as noise in telephone terminals, and will affect and often degrade the service in fax, dataphones and modems.",
        "From the point of view of DSL devices, any acceptance of their signal by POTS devices mean that there is a degradation of the DSL signal to the devices, and this is the central reason why these filters are required.",
        "A side effect of the move to the self-install model is that the DSL signal can be degraded, especially if more than 5 voiceband that is, POTS telephone-like devices are connected to the line.",
        "Once a line has had DSL enabled, the DSL signal is present on all telephone wiring in the building, causing attenuation and echo.",
        "A way to circumvent this is to go back to the original model, and install one filter upstream from all telephone jacks in the building, except for the jack to which the DSL modem will be connected.",
        "Since this requires wiring changes by the customer, and may not work on some household telephone wiring, it is rarely done.",
        "It is usually much easier to install filters at each telephone jack that is in use.",
        "DSL signals may be degraded by older telephone lines, surge protectors, poorly designed microfilters, repetitive electrical impulse noise, and by long telephone extension cords.",
        "Telephone extension cords are typically made with small-gauge, multi-strand copper conductors which do not maintain a noise-reducing pair twist.",
        "Such cable is more susceptible to electromagnetic interference and has more attenuation than solid twisted-pair copper wires typically wired to telephone jacks.",
        "These effects are especially significant where the customer s phone line is more than 4 km from the DSLAM in the telephone exchange, which causes the signal levels to be lower relative to any local noise and attenuation.",
        "This will have the effect of reducing speeds or causing connection failures.",
        "Transport protocols ADSL defines three Transmission protocol-specific transmission convergence TPS-TC layers 5 Synchronous Transport Module STM , which allows the transmission of frames of the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SDH Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM Packet Transfer Mode starting with ADSL2, see below In home installation, the prevalent transport protocol is ATM.",

        "Agile software development In software development, agile sometimes written Agile 1 is a set of practices intended to improve the effectiveness of software development professionals, teams, and organizations.",
        "It involves discovering requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross- functional teams and their customer s /end user s .",
        "2 It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to changes in requirements, resource availability, and understanding of the problems to be solved.",
        "3 4 It was popularized by the 2001 Manifesto for Agile Software Development.",
        "5 The values and principles exposed in this manifesto were derived from and underpin a broad range of software development frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban.",
        "6 7 While there is much anecdotal evidence that adopting agile practices and values improves the effectiveness of software professionals, teams and organizations, the empirical evidence is mixed and hard to find.",
        "8 9 History Iterative and incremental software development methods can be traced back as early as 1957, 10 with evolutionary project management 11 12 and adaptive software development 13 emerging in the early 1970s.",
        "14 During the 1990s, a number of lightweight software development methods evolved in reaction to the prevailing heavyweight methods often referred to collectively as waterfall that critics described as overly regulated, planned, and micromanaged.",
        "These included rapid application development RAD , from 1991 15 16 the unified process UP and dynamic systems development method DSDM , both from 1994 Scrum, from 1995 Crystal Clear and extreme programming XP , both from 1996 and feature- driven development, from 1997.",
        "Although these all originated before the publication of the Agile Manifesto, they are now collectively referred to as agile software development methods.",
        "7 At the same time, similar changes were underway in manufacturing 17 18 and management thinking.",
        "In 2001, these seventeen software developers met at a resort in Snowbird, Utah to discuss these lightweight development methods Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, Dave Thomas, Jeff Sutherland, Ken Schwaber, Jim Highsmith, Alistair Cockburn, Robert C. Martin, Mike Beedle, Arie van Bennekum, Martin Fowler, James Grenning, Andrew Hunt, Ron Jeffries, Jon Kern, Brian Marick, and Steve Mellor.",
        "Together they published the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.",
        "5 In 2005, a group headed by Cockburn and Highsmith wrote an addendum of project management principles, the PM Declaration of Interdependence, 19 to guide software project management according to agile software development methods.",
        "In 2009, a group working with Martin wrote an extension of software development principles, the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto, to guide agile software development according to professional conduct and mastery.",
        "In 2011, the Agile Alliance created the Guide to Agile Practices renamed the Agile Glossary in 2016 , 20 an evolving open-source compendium of the working definitions of agile practices, terms, and elements, along with interpretations and experience guidelines from the worldwide community of agile practitioners.",
        "The Manifesto for Agile Software Development Agile software development values Based on their combined experience of developing software and helping others do that, the seventeen signatories to the manifesto proclaimed that they value 5 Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan That is to say, the items on the left are valued more than the items on the right.",
        "It is not to say that the items on the right should be excluded in favor of the items on the left.",
        "Both sides have value, but from an Agile Development point of view the authors of the manifesto tip the balance in favor of the items on the left.",
        "As Scott Ambler elucidated 21 Tools and processes are important, but it is more important to have competent people working together effectively.",
        "Good documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it, but the main point of development is to create software, not documentation.",
        "A contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need.",
        "A project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholders priorities, and people s understanding of the problem and its solution.",
        "Some of the authors formed the Agile Alliance, a non-profit organization that promotes software development according to the manifesto s values and principles.",
        "Introducing the manifesto on behalf of the Agile Alliance, Jim Highsmith said, The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology.",
        "We want to restore a balance.",
        "We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository.",
        "We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes.",
        "We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment.",
        "Those who would brand proponents of XP or SCRUM or any of the other Agile Methodologies as hackers are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker.",
        "\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Jim Highsmith, History The Agile Manifesto 22 Agile software development principles Agile software development principles The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles 23 1.",
        "Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.",

        "Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.",
        "3.",
        "Deliver working software frequently weeks rather than months 4.",
        "Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers 5.",
        "Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted 6.",
        "Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication co-location 7.",
        "Working software is the primary measure of progress 8.",
        "Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace 9.",
        "Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design 10.",
        "Simplicity\u00e2\u0080\u0094the art of maximizing the amount of work not done\u00e2\u0080\u0094is essential 11.",
        "Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams 12.",
        "Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly Overview Iterative, incremental, and evolutionary Most agile development methods break product development work into small increments that minimize the amount of up-front planning and design.",
        "Iterations, or sprints, are short time frames timeboxes that typically last from one to four weeks.",
        "Each iteration involves a cross-functional team working in all functions planning, analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing.",
        "At the end of the iteration a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders.",
        "This minimizes overall risk and allows the product to adapt to changes quickly.",
        "24 An iteration might not add enough functionality to warrant a market release, but the goal is to have an available release with minimal bugs at the end of each iteration.",
        "25 Through incremental development products have room to fail often and early throughout each iterative phase instead of drastically on a final release date.",
        "26 Multiple iterations might be required to release a product or new features.",
        "Working software is the primary measure of progress.",
        "23 Efficient and face-to-face communication The principle of co-location is that co-workers on the same team should be situated together to better establish the identity as a team and to improve communication.",
        "27 This enables face-to-face interaction, ideally in front of a whiteboard, that reduces the cycle time typically taken when questions and answers are mediated through phone, persistent chat, wiki, or email.",
        "28 No matter which development method is followed, every team should include a customer representative Product Owner in Scrum .",
        "This person is agreed by stakeholders to act on their behalf and makes a personal commitment to being available for developers to answer questions throughout the iteration.",
        "At the end of each iteration, stakeholders and the customer representative review progress and re-evaluate priorities with a view to optimizing the return on investment ROI and ensuring alignment with customer needs and company goals.",
        "The importance of stakeholder satisfaction, detailed by frequent interaction and review at the end of each phase, is why the methodology is often denoted as a Customer Centered Methodology .",
        "29 In agile software development, an information radiator is a normally large physical display located prominently near the development team, where passers-by can see it.",
        "It presents an up-to-date summary of the product development status.",
        "30 31 A build light indicator may also be used to inform a team about the current status of their product development.",
        "Very short feedback loop and adaptation cycle A common characteristic in agile software development is the daily stand-up a daily scrum in Scrum framework .",
        "In a brief session, team members report to each other what they did the previous day toward their team s iteration goal, what they intend to do today toward the goal, and any roadblocks or impediments they can see to the goal.",
        "32 Quality focus Specific tools and techniques, such as continuous integration, automated unit testing, pair programming, test-driven development, design patterns, behavior-driven development, domain-driven design, code refactoring and other techniques are often used to improve quality and enhance product development agility.",
        "33 This is predicated on designing and building quality in from the beginning and being able to demonstrate software for customers at any point, or at least at the end of every iteration.",
        "34 Philosophy Compared to traditional software engineering, agile software development mainly targets complex systems and product development with dynamic, non-deterministic and non-linear characteristics.",
        "Accurate estimates, stable plans, and predictions are often hard to get in early stages, and confidence in them is likely to be low.",
        "Agile practitioners will seek to reduce the leap-of-faith that is needed before any evidence of value can be obtained.",
        "35 Requirements and design are held to be emergent.",
        "Big up-front specifications would probably cause a lot of waste in such cases, i.e., are not economically sound.",
        "These basic arguments and previous industry experiences, learned from years of successes and failures, have helped shape agile development s favor of adaptive, iterative and evolutionary development.",
        "36 Adaptive vs. predictive Development methods exist on a continuum from adaptive to predictive.",
        "37 Agile software development methods lie on the adaptive side of this continuum.",
        "One key of adaptive development methods is a rolling wave approach to schedule planning, which identifies milestones but leaves flexibility in the path to reach them, and also allows for the milestones themselves to change.",
        "38 Adaptive methods focus on adapting quickly to changing realities.",
        "When the needs of a project change, an adaptive team changes as well.",
        "An adaptive team has difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future.",
        "The further away a date is, the more vague an adaptive method is about what will happen on that date.",
        "An adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks they will do next week, but only which features they plan for next month.",
        "When asked about a release six months from now, an adaptive team might be able to report only the mission statement for the release, or a statement of expected value vs. cost.",
        "Predictive methods, in contrast, focus on analysing and planning the future in detail and cater for known risks.",
        "In the extremes, a predictive team can report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the development process.",
        "Predictive methods rely on effective early phase analysis and if this goes very wrong, the project may have difficulty changing direction.",
        "Predictive teams often institute a change control board to ensure they consider only the most valuable changes.",
        "Risk analysis can be used to choose between adaptive agile or value-driven and predictive plan-driven methods.",
        "39 Barry Boehm and Richard Turner suggest that each side of the continuum has its own home ground, as follows 40 Agile vs. waterfall Home grounds of different development methods Plan-driven methods High criticality Junior developers ?",
        "Requirements do not change often Large number of developers Culture that demands order Formal methods Extreme criticality Senior developers Limited requirements, limited features see Wirth s law Requirements that can be modeled Extreme quality One of the differences between agile software development methods and waterfall is the approach to quality and testing.",
        "In the waterfall model, work moves through Software Development Lifecycle SDLC phases\u00e2\u0080\u0094with one phase being completed before another can start\u00e2\u0080\u0094hence the testing phase is separate and follows a build phase.",
        "In agile software development, however, testing is completed in the same iteration as programming.",
        "Another way of looking at it is \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgile make it up as you go along.",
        "Waterfall make it up before you start, live with the consequences\u00e2\u0080\u009d.",
        "41 Because testing is done in every iteration\u00e2\u0080\u0094which develops a small piece of the software\u00e2\u0080\u0094users can frequently use those new pieces of software and validate the value.",
        "After the users know the real value of the updated piece of software, they can make better decisions about the software s future.",
        "Having a value retrospective and software re-planning session in each iteration\u00e2\u0080\u0094Scrum typically has iterations of just two weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0094helps the team continuously adapt its plans so as to maximize the value it delivers.",
        "This follows a pattern similar to the Plan-Do-Check-Act PDCA cycle, as the work is planned, done, checked in the review and retrospective , and any changes agreed are acted upon.",
        "This iterative approach supports a product rather than a project mindset.",
        "This provides greater flexibility throughout the development process whereas on projects the requirements are defined and locked down from the very beginning, making it difficult to change them later.",
        "Iterative product development allows the software to evolve in response to changes in business environment or market requirements.",
        "Code vs. documentation In a letter to IEEE Computer, Steven Rakitin expressed cynicism about agile software development, calling it yet another attempt to undermine the discipline of software engineering and translating working software over comprehensive documentation as we want to spend all our time coding.",
        "Remember, real programmers don t write documentation.",
        "42 This is disputed by proponents of agile software development, who state that developers should write documentation if that is the best way to achieve the relevant goals, but that there are often better ways to achieve those goals than writing static documentation.",
        "43 Scott Ambler states that documentation should be just barely good enough JBGE , 44 that too much or comprehensive documentation would usually cause waste, and developers rarely trust detailed documentation because it s usually out of sync with code, 43 while too little documentation may also cause problems for maintenance, communication, learning and knowledge sharing.",
        "Alistair Cockburn wrote of the Crystal Clear method Crystal considers development a series of co-operative games, and intends that the documentation is enough to help the next win at the next game.",
        "The work products for Crystal include use cases, risk list, iteration plan, core domain models, and design notes to inform on choices...however there are no templates for these documents and descriptions are necessarily vague, but the objective is clear, just enough documentation for the next game.",
        "I always tend to characterize this to my team as what would you want to know if you joined the team tomorrow.",
        "Agile software development methods Agile software development methods support a broad range of the software development life cycle.",
        "46 Some methods focus on the practices e.g., XP, pragmatic programming, agile modeling , while some focus on managing the flow of work e.g., Scrum, Kanban .",
        "Some support activities for requirements specification and development e.g., FDD , while some seek to cover the full development life cycle e.g., DSDM, RUP .",
        "Method In the literature, different terms refer to the notion of method adaptation, including method tailoring , method fragment adaptation and situational method engineering .",
        "Method tailoring is defined as A process or capability in which human agents determine a system development approach for a specific project situation through responsive changes in, and dynamic interplays between contexts, intentions, and method fragments.",
        "\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mehmet Nafiz Aydin et al., An Agile Information Systems Development Method in use 48 Situation-appropriateness should be considered as a distinguishing characteristic between agile methods and more plan-driven software development methods, with agile methods allowing product development teams to adapt working practices according to the needs of individual products.",
        "49 48 Potentially, most agile methods could be suitable for method tailoring, 46 such as DSDM tailored in a CMM context.",
        "50 and XP tailored with the Rule Description Practices RDP technique.",
        "51 Not all agile proponents agree, however, with Schwaber noting that is how we got into trouble in the first place, thinking that the problem was not having a perfect methodology.",
        "Efforts should center on the changes needed in the enterprise .",
        "52 Bas Vodde reinforced this viewpoint, suggesting that unlike traditional, large methodologies that require you to pick and choose elements, Scrum provides the basics on top of which you add additional elements to localise and contextualise its use.",
        "53 Practitioners seldom use system development methods, or agile methods specifically, by the book, often choosing to omit or tailor some of the practices of a method in order to create an in-house method.",
        "54 In practice, methods can be tailored using various tools.",
        "Generic process modeling languages such as Unified Modeling Language can be used to tailor software development methods.",
        "However, dedicated tools for method engineering such as the Essence Theory of Software Engineering of SEMAT also exist.",
        "55 Large-scale, offshore and distributed Agile software development has been widely seen as highly suited to certain types of environments, including small teams of experts working on greenfield projects, 40 56 157 and the challenges and limitations encountered in the adoption of agile software development methods in a large organization with legacy infrastructure are well-documented and understood.",
        "57 In response, a range of strategies and patterns has evolved for overcoming challenges with large-scale development efforts >20 developers 58 59 or distributed non-colocated development teams, 60 61 amongst other challenges and there are now several recognised frameworks that seek to mitigate or avoid these challenges.",
        "Scaled agile framework SAFe , 62 Dean Leffingwell et al Disciplined agile delivery DAD , Scott Ambler et al Large-scale scrum LeSS , Craig Larman and Bas Vodde Nexus scaled professional Scrum , 63 Ken Schwaber Scrum at Scale, 64 Jeff Sutherland, Alex Brown Enterprise Scrum, 65 Mike Beedle Setchu Scrum-based lightweight framework , 66 Michael Ebbage XSCALE 67 Agile path 68 -- Holistic Software Development 69 There are many conflicting viewpoints on whether all of these are effective or indeed fit the definition of agile development, and this remains an active and ongoing area of research.",
        "58 70 When agile software development is applied in a distributed setting with teams dispersed across multiple business locations , it is commonly referred to as Distributed agile software development.",
        "The goal is to leverage the unique benefits offered by each approach.",
        "Distributed development allows organizations to build software by strategically setting up teams in different parts of the globe, virtually building software round-the-clock more commonly referred to as follow-the-sun model .",
        "On the other hand, agile development provides increased transparency, continuous feedback, and more flexibility when responding to changes.",
        "Regulated domains Agile software development methods were initially seen as best suitable for non-critical product developments, thereby excluded from use in regulated domains such as medical devices, pharmaceutical, financial, nuclear systems, automotive, and avionics sectors, etc.",
        "However, in the last several years, there have been several initiatives for the adaptation of agile methods for these domains.",
        "71 72 73 74 75 There are numerous standards that may apply in regulated domains, including ISO 26262, ISO 9000, ISO 9001, and ISO/IEC 15504.",
        "A number of key concerns are of particular importance in regulated domains 76 Quality assurance QA Systematic and inherent quality management underpinning a controlled professional process and reliability and correctness of product.",
        "Safety and security Formal planning and risk management to mitigate safety risks for users and securely protecting users from unintentional and malicious misuse.",
        "Traceability Documentation providing auditable evidence of regulatory compliance and facilitating traceability and investigation of problems.",
        "Verification and Validation V V Embedded throughout the software development process e.g.",
        "user requirements specification, functional specification, design specification, code review, unit tests, integration tests, system tests .",
        "Experience and adoption Although agile software development methods can be used with any programming paradigm or language in practice, they were originally closely associated with object-oriented environments such as Smalltalk, Lisp and later Java, C .",
        "The initial adopters of agile methods were usually small to medium-sized teams working on unprecedented systems with requirements that were difficult to finalize and likely to change as the system was being developed.",
        "This section describes common problems that organizations encounter when they try to adopt agile software development methods as well as various techniques to measure the quality and performance of agile teams.",
        "77 Measuring agility Internal assessments The Agility measurement index, amongst others, rates developments against five dimensions of product development duration, risk, novelty, effort, and interaction .",
        "78 79 Other techniques are based on measurable goals 80 and one study suggests that velocity can be used as a metric of agility.",
        "81 There are also agile self-assessments to determine whether a team is using agile software development practices Nokia test, 82 Karlskrona test, 83 42 points test .",
        "84 Public surveys One of the early studies reporting gains in quality, productivity, and business satisfaction by using agile software developments methods was a survey conducted by Shine Technologies from November 2002 to January 2003.",
        "85 A similar survey, the State of Agile, is conducted every year starting in 2006 with thousands of participants from around the software development community.",
        "This tracks trends on the perceived benefits of agility, lessons learned, and good practices.",
        "Each survey has reported increasing numbers saying that agile software development helps them deliver software faster improves their ability to manage changing customer priorities and increases their productivity.",
        "86 Surveys have also consistently shown better results with agile product development methods compared to classical project management.",
        "87 88 In balance, there are reports that some feel that agile development methods are still too young to enable extensive academic research of their success.",
        "89 Common agile software development pitfalls Organizations and teams implementing agile software development often face difficulties transitioning from more traditional methods such as waterfall development, such as teams having an agile process forced on them.",
        "90 These are often termed agile anti-patterns or more commonly agile smells.",
        "Below are some common examples Lack of overall product design A goal of agile software development is to focus more on producing working software and less on documentation.",
        "This is in contrast to waterfall models where the process is often highly controlled and minor changes to the system require significant revision of supporting documentation.",
        "However, this does not justify completely doing without any analysis or design at all.",
        "Failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly at first but then to have significant rework required as they attempt to scale up the system.",
        "One of the key features of agile software development is that it is iterative.",
        "When done correctly design emerges as the system is developed and commonalities and opportunities for re-use are discovered.",
        "91 Adding stories to an iteration in progress In agile software development, stories similar to use case descriptions are typically used to define requirements and an iteration is a short period of time during which the team commits to specific goals.",
        "92 Adding stories to an iteration in progress is detrimental to a good flow of work.",
        "These should be added to the product backlog and prioritized for a subsequent iteration or in rare cases the iteration could be cancelled.",
        "93 This does not mean that a story cannot expand.",
        "Teams must deal with new information, which may produce additional tasks for a story.",
        "If the new information prevents the story from being completed during the iteration, then it should be carried over to a subsequent iteration.",
        "However, it should be prioritized against all remaining stories, as the new information may have changed the story s original priority.",
        "Lack of sponsor support Agile software development is often implemented as a grassroots effort in organizations by software development teams trying to optimize their development processes and ensure consistency in the software development life cycle.",
        "By not having sponsor support, teams may face difficulties and resistance from business partners, other development teams and management.",
        "Additionally, they may suffer without appropriate funding and resources.",
        "94 This increases the likelihood of failure.",
        "95 Insufficient training A survey performed by VersionOne found respondents cited insufficient training as the most significant cause for failed agile implementations 96 Teams have fallen into the trap of assuming the reduced processes of agile software development compared to other methodologies such as waterfall means that there are no actual rules for agile software development."

        "1 Systems for process control and protective relays used analog computation to perform control and protective functions.",
        "Analog computers were widely used in scientific and industrial applications even after the advent of digital computers, because at the time they were typically much faster, but they started to become obsolete as early as the 1950s and 1960s, although they remained in use in some specific applications, such as aircraft flight simulators, the flight computer in aircraft, and for teaching control systems in universities.",
        "More complex applications, such as aircraft flight simulators and synthetic-aperture radar, remained the domain of analog computing and hybrid computing well into the 1980s, since digital computers were insufficient for the task.",
